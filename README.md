# Databot
## A Slack bot with data querying capabilities
- Built using [Slack's Bolt Framework](https://api.slack.com/tools/bolt), send hourly message to channel, (since the bot joined the channel) asking if user has any query.
- Mention the bot in the channel with the query and the bot will respond with the result.
- Welcomes the new user in the channel.
- Can be installed in any workspace using the [OAuth flow](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2).
- Uses [OpenAI's](https://platform.openai.com/examples/default-sql-translate) API to translate natural language to SQL query.

### Try asking question in this manner:

    how many users from Lucknow use Samsung phones?

    How many users joined yesterday?
